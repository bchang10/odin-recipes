    <h1>Beef Bulgogi Recipe</h1>

    <p>
        Bulgogi, sometimes known as Korean BBQ beef, is a dish 
        of thinly sliced grilled steak that has been marinated 
        in a sweet soy, sesame, and garlic sauce. If you want 
        to spice it up, serve the beef in lettuce cups with rice and hot pepper paste (gochujang).
